TIMELIGHT
Metaphysical deterministic computational for path generation and rendering

The model uses basic ideas, but just modelled well.
(MAYBE it explores how consciousness and time interact to create emergent reality patterns through binary choices, maybe it doesn't, at least you have a way to play with it and I really hope you do crazy things with this once you understand what it really is)

INPUT: sequence of bits
OUTPUT: sequence of bits that is used as INPUT in the next round
METHOD:
sequence of bits is XORed with a global sequence that is another sequence of bits which is finite but it goes on repeat and doesn't change between rounds.
There is also a method for growing and shrinking sequences as they are produced, and as the sequences grow, bits from global time are used to keep the results non-random.
That is it.

The engine has a global word that can be set, and then you give it a word, and it produces words. NON RANDOM. It's a fully reversible and traceable method. If you have loads of memory and fast CPU, please go crazy.

The second part of Timelight is rendering the sequences using a modified approach to turtle walk.
It draws straight lines based on the bits, but not like regular turtle walk, where bit-0 would turn left at angle alfa, and bit-1 would turn right at angle alfa.
There is a global angle set.
And each 0 and 1 simply increase or decrease that global angle by a set increment amount.
Each word, a bit is taken, the angle is modified, the "turtle" turns by the value of global angle, and it draws a straight line of set length forward. Take another bit and repeat.
After sequence is over, start again with the new word.

You can draw each new word starting from the same origin position, which is a 4D view of the history of sequences, or you can draw each new word from where you ended up drawing the previous one.

That's it for the model as it is presented here.

We highly recommend you to play with it and try to understand what it is and what it represents.

Thank you everyone for all the patterns you've showed me.

All of this model is open-sourced on MIT licence by Rafał Borkowski.

This is the answer.
